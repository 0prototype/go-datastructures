Package palm implements parallel architecture-friendly latch-free
modifications (PALM).  Details can be found here:

http://cs.unc.edu/~sewall/palm.pdf

The primary purpose of the tree is to efficiently batch operations
in such a way that locks are not required.  This is most beneficial
for in-memory indices.  Otherwise, the operations have typical B-tree
time complexities.

You primarily see the benefits of multithreading in availability and
bulk operations, below is a benchmark against the B-plus tree in this
package.

// Keys is a typed list of Key interfaces.
type Keys []Key

// Key defines items that can be inserted into or searched for
// in the tree.
type Key interface {
	// Compare should return an int indicating how this key relates
	// to the provided key.  -1 will indicate less than, 0 will indicate
	// equality, and 1 will indicate greater than.  Duplicate keys
	// are allowed, but duplicate IDs are not.
	Compare(Key) int
